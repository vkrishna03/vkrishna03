## About Me

``` javascript
const vamshiKrishna = {
    title: "Software Engineer",
    specialization: "Keeping the codebase clean while putting out startup fires",
    motto: "When the founders are away, I lead the team astray (into better code, of course).",
    skills: ["Team Leadership", "Web Dev Mastery", "Startup Survival Mode"],
    debugMode: false // I prefer writing code that doesn't need it.
};
```

Hey there! I’m your go-to Software Engineer who not only crafts elegant code but also keeps the startup ship afloat when the founders are MIA (Missing In Action, not Method Invocation Argument, for the non-techies). Think of me as a Swiss Army knife in the world of software engineering—I handle everything from leading a team to squashing bugs, all while keeping the chaos under control.

I have a deep love for clean code, a knack for refactoring until perfection, and an occasional tendency to chat with AI models like they’re my pets. Currently pursuing a B.Tech in CSE (AI & ML), I’m on a mission to compile my life into a bug-free runtime, one line of code at a time.

## Tech Stack

- **Languages**: Python, C, JavaScript, TypeScript, SQL, JAVA (Just Another Vague Acronym)
- **Web Technologies & Frameworks**: ReactJS, Spring Boot, MUI, TailwindCSS, Redux, NodeJS (and, yes, I've Googled “Why is my Node app slow?” more times than I care to admit)
- **Databases & Tools**: PostgreSQL, MySQL, Oracle 10g, Docker (containers so isolated they have trust issues), Maven, GIT (because everyone needs a “reset --hard” sometimes)
- **Secret Weapon**: Coffee. Lots of it.

## Projects

- **[Simple Expense Tracker App](#)** (October '23): Built a web app to track expenses so I can pretend I have financial discipline. Stack: ReactJS, Spring Boot, PostgreSQL.
- **[Service Health Monitoring System](#)** (September '23): Because “Are you alive?” is a valid question for both services and Monday mornings. Stack: ReactJS, NodeJS, ExpressJS, MongoDB.


## Fun Fact

- Leading students through the chaotic wonderland of tech, all while pretending to know the answers to everything.
- Provided tech support and organized events, debugging students' lives one code snippet at a time.
- When I’m not coding, I’m hitting the high notes—because both require good rhythm and a lot of practice.
- Performed for over 3000 people. Turns out, a good loop isn't just for code.

Remember: Code is poetry, but sometimes, it’s just a really long novel with no ending in sight.

Also remember: When the going gets tough, the tough get coding.
