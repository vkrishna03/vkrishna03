## üë®‚Äçüíª About Me

```javascript
const vamshiKrishna = {
    title: "Software Engineer",
    specialization: "Keeping the codebase clean while putting out startup fires",
    motto: "When the founders are away, I lead the team astray (into better code, of course).",
    skills: ["Team Leadership", "Web Dev Mastery", "Startup Survival Mode"],
    debugMode: false // I prefer writing code that doesn't need it.
};
```

Hey there! I‚Äôm Vamshi Krishna, your go-to Software Engineer who not only crafts elegant code but also keeps the startup ship afloat when the founders are MIA (Missing In Action, not Method Invocation Argument, for the non-techies). Think of me as a Swiss Army knife in the world of software engineering‚ÄîI handle everything from leading a team to squashing bugs, all while keeping the chaos under control.

I have a deep love for clean code, a knack for refactoring until perfection, and an occasional tendency to chat with AI models like they‚Äôre my pets. Currently pursuing a B.Tech in CSE (AI & ML), I‚Äôm on a mission to compile my life into a bug-free runtime, one line of code at a time.

## üíº Experience

### Software Engineer Intern, [Ezynest LLC](https://ezynest.com)
**October 2023 - Present | Remote**
- **Team Leadership**: When the founders vanish (which they do), I take the helm, ensuring the team runs like a well-oiled CI/CD pipeline‚Äîminus the downtime.
- **UI Development**: Crafted a ReactJS app so sleek, even your grandmother could navigate it‚Äîbecause let's be honest, she‚Äôs probably better at tech than you think.
- **Custom Component Library**: Built a custom component library using Radix UI and Tailwind CSS, making me feel like I invented React but with fewer bugs and more sanity.
- **Multi-Theming**: Implemented multi-theming because, apparently, users have opinions about light vs. dark mode‚Äîwho knew?
- **Code Refactoring**: Refactored code until I could swear it gained sentience (or maybe that‚Äôs just the caffeine talking).
- **Micro-services & APIs**: Wrote REST APIs with Spring Boot and PostgreSQL, and now my services are so micro, they‚Äôre practically nano.
- **LLM Integration**: Integrated OpenAI‚Äôs LLM model into the backend, making our app smart enough to predict when you‚Äôll need a coffee break.
- **Messaging**: Implemented RabbitMQ because sometimes you just need a message queue that hops, skips, and jumps over bugs.

## üéì Education

### Mahatma Gandhi Institute of Technology, Hyderabad, India
**Bachelor of Technology - Computer Science and Engineering (AI & ML) | CGPA: 7.6**

Learned everything from turning coffee into code to handling null pointers in life (and in Java). If degrees came with badges, mine would say ‚ÄúCertified in AI & ML, Fluent in Sarcasm.‚Äù

## üõ† Skills

- **Languages**: Python, C, JavaScript, TypeScript, SQL, JAVA (Just Another Vague Acronym)
- **Web Technologies & Frameworks**: ReactJS, Spring Boot, MUI, TailwindCSS, Redux, NodeJS (and, yes, I've Googled ‚ÄúWhy is my Node app slow?‚Äù more times than I care to admit)
- **Databases & Tools**: PostgreSQL, MySQL, Oracle 10g, Docker (containers so isolated they have trust issues), Maven, GIT (because everyone needs a ‚Äúreset --hard‚Äù sometimes)
- **Soft Skills**: Leadership (Turning junior developers into full-stack ninjas while handling my own tasks like a boss.), Event Management, Public Speaking (or as I like to call it, ‚Äúhuman exception handling‚Äù), Time Management

## üé§ Volunteer Experience

- **Technical Lead**, Idea Incubator (Student Club MGIT)
  - Leading students through the chaotic wonderland of tech, all while pretending to know the answers to everything.
  - Provided tech support and organized events, debugging students' lives one code snippet at a time.
  
- **Lead Singer**, The Symphony (Student Music Club MGIT)
  - When I‚Äôm not coding, I‚Äôm hitting the high notes‚Äîbecause both require good rhythm and a lot of practice.
  - Performed for over 3000 people. Turns out, a good loop isn't just for code.

Remember: Code is poetry, but sometimes, it‚Äôs just a really long novel with no ending in sight.

Also remember: When the going gets tough, the tough get coding.
