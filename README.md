Hello! I’m your go-to Software Engineer—balancing technical excellence with leadership skills, especially in the dynamic environment of a startup. I thrive when coding and leading, always aiming to keep the team and codebase in top shape. Think of me as a versatile tool in software engineering: I handle everything from mentoring teammates to refining algorithms, all while staying calm amidst the chaos.

I have a deep love for clean code, a knack for refactoring until perfection, and an occasional tendency to chat with AI models like they’re my pets. Currently pursuing a B.Tech in CSE (AI & ML), I’m on a mission to compile my life into a bug-free runtime, one line of code at a time.
